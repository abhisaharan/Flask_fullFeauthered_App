# Before we run the application we need to set environment variable to the file that we want to be our flask application.

    - export FLASK_APP=flaskblog

# To run the server: flask run

# to run in debuf mode: "export FLASK_DEBUG=1" and then "flask run"

# if we dont want to use all these environment variable the better way is to put
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

    and now we can call the script direclty
        - python flaskblog.py
